## Aim
When an operating system switches from one kernel-level thread to another, it is called a context switch. During this switch, data stored in the cache memory is usually lost. The goal of this project is to investigate the benefits of having multiple small "cache-storage-cores" and selecting the appropriate core during a context switch. By doing so, the project aims to preserve the cached data and improve the efficiency of the context switch process.
