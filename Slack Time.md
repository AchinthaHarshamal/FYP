## Setup Slack
Setup slack measures the amount of time by which the input signal to a flip-flop or latch must arrive earlier than the required setup time before the clock edge. It represents the timing margin available for the data to stabilize before the clock triggers the storage element.


## Hold Slack
Hold slack measures the amount of time by which the input signal to a flip-flop or latch must remain stable after the clock edge. It represents the timing margin available for the data to hold its value after the clock triggers the storage element.
